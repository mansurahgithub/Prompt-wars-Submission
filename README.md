> A Jedi vs. Sith-themed food donation platform that connects those who have surplus food to those in need — faster than the Millennium Falcon makes the Kessel Run.

## Overview

**FoodBridge** is a web platform that facilitates **real-time food donation** within apartment communities and nearby areas. Designed with a playful **Star Wars-inspired theme**, it offers an intuitive and interactive experience for both donors and distributors, blending utility with creativity.

With features like **role-based login**, **Aadhaar verification**, and **location-based collection**, FoodBridge ensures **zero food wastage**, **faster distribution**, and **community-driven action**.

## Problem It Solves

- **Food Wastage**: Tons of edible food go to waste every day while others go hungry.
- **Delayed Distribution**: NGO food drives often suffer from logistical delays.
- **Verification Issues**: Difficulty in authenticating beneficiaries leads to misuse.
- **Donor Disengagement**: Donors have no clear visibility or incentive to contribute frequently.
